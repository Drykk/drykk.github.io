Name is Tom or Drykk depending if we met online or in person first. I am currently a Security Engineer by trade and work in the PNW. I have a kiddo in school and loving being a dad. I used to stream games on a website that was called Mixer before Microsoft did their thing to it and sold off the peices. Now I just am snarky on the internet via social media and play videogames for fun. I am learning to blacksmith and hope to post and do more with that soon.
