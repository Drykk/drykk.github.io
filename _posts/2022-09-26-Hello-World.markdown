This will be my first Jekyll post! Ok not really but I doubt you saw me stuggling this evening trying to load this bloddy thing and its templates. Tell you what, that was not a fun evening trying to use a template. Really need to build this from scratch to sew what it does and how it interacts. Well I guess that is enough fun for this first post and the evening.

>Super Fun... Not

Anyway. That should be it for now.
